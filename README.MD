# ðŸ’œ Different Love App

I was given a task @AppleSeeds Bootcamp to make an responsive web application using React that includes CRUD functionality.
I decided to build an application that allows people to showcase their hobbies and interests, and interact with others who share similar passions.<br>
I implement the project using `HTML`,`CSS`,`JavaScript`,`React`.

### Deployment

In order to run the app locally you will need to install all the dependencies from the package.json file.
Run the command npm install to install all the dependencies, after it's done you can run npm start to start the app locally in localhost:3000
