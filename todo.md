# Without changing the chat code.

- Add signin with firebase on the terms page(Let's start)
- If user already completed onboarding take to users list page
- If new user, take to details form and trivia to complete the profile

- We need to attach the firebase profile with the mockapi user entry.
  Maybe by saving the user id from the mock api in the firebase, or saving firebase user if in the mock api entry (uuid or email if we have it)
